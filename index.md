### Hello There üëã
I'm Awsaf. I'm a **Data Science and Deep Learning** enthusiast. Though currently, I'm studying **Electrical and Electronics Engineering**, I'm passionate about **Data Science and Deep Learning**. I've also contributed to real-life research works where I've been able to apply the knowledge of **Deep Learning** mostly on **Computer Vision**. Two of my works already have been published. I also love to put my knowledge of Deep Learning onto the test while participating in a Data Science competition where I get to use **Deep Learning** in a competitive environment(**Kaggle, DrivenData, Grand Challenge, etc**). I'm also very fond of **Signal Processing** where I can get to know how **Deep Learning** models work under the hood. I love to work a problem, make my hand dirty by coding and do analysis afterward.
